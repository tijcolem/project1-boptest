# IBPSA Project 1 - BOPTEST

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest)

Building Optimization Performance Tests

This repository contains code for the Building Optimization Performance Test framework (BOPTEST)
that is being developed as part of the IBPSA Project 1 (https://ibpsa.github.io/project1/).

## Structure
- ``/testcases`` contains test cases, including docs, models, and configuration settings.
- ``/examples`` contains code for interacting with a test case and running example tests with simple controllers.  Those controllers are implemented in Python (Version 2.7 and 3.9), Julia (Version 1.0.3), and JavaScript (Version ECMAScript 2018).
- ``/parsing`` contains code for a script that parses a Modelica model using signal exchange blocks and outputs a wrapper FMU and KPI json.
- ``/testing`` contains code for unit and functional testing of this software.  See the README there for more information about running these tests.
- ``/data`` contains code for generating and managing data associated with test cases.  This includes boundary conditions, such as weather, schedules, and energy prices, as well as a map of test case FMU outputs needed to calculate KPIs.
- ``/forecast`` contains code for returning boundary condition forecast, such as weather, schedules, and energy prices.
- ``/kpis`` contains code for calculating key performance indicators.
- ``/docs`` contains design requirements and guide documentation.

##2) Build the test case by ``$ make build`` where <testcase_dir_name> is the name of the test case subdirectory located in ``/testcases``.
## Quick-Start to Run Test Cases
1) Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2) Build the BOPTEST Service by ``$ make build``.
3) Start the BOPTEST Service by ``$ make run``.
4) In a separate process, use the test case API defined below to interact with a test case using your test controller.  Alternatively, view and run an example test controller as described in the next step.
5) Run an example test controller:

* For Python-based example controllers:
  * Build and run the BOPTEST Service.  Then, in a separate terminal, use ``$ cd examples/python/ && python testcase1.py`` to test a simple proportional feedback controller on this test case over a two-day period.
  * Build and run the BOPTEST Service.  Then, in a separate terminal, use ``$ cd examples/python/ && python testcase1_scenario.py`` to test a simple proportional feedback controller on this test case over a test period defined using the ``/scenario`` API.
  * Build and run the BOPTEST Service.  Then, in a separate terminal, use ``$ cd examples/python/ && python testcase2.py`` to test a simple supervisory controller on this test case over a two-day period.

* Julia-based example controllers are not yet updated according to BOPTEST Service conventions

6) Shutdown the Service from the terminal window using ``Ctrl+C``.
7) Remove the test case Docker image by ``$ make remove-image``.

## Test Case RESTful API
- To run a test, use the API defined in the table below by sending RESTful requests to: ``http://127.0.0.1/<request>/<testid>``
- In BOPTEST Service there can be many tests running concurently. The ``select`` API is used to begin a test and retrieve a unique ``testid`` which is used for further API requests related to the test: ``curl -X POST  http://127.0.0.1/testcases/testcase1/select``. The value ``testcase1`` can be any one of the available BOPTEST test cases reported by the API: GET ``http://127.0.0.1/testcases/``.

Example RESTful interaction:

- Begin a test and retrieve a unique ``testid``: ``$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1/testcases/testcase1/select``
- Receive a list of available measurement names and their metadata: ``$ curl http://127.0.0.1/measurements/<testid>``
- Receive a forecast of boundary condition data: ``$ curl http://127.0.0.1/forecast/<testid>``
- Advance simulation of test case 2 with new heating and cooling temperature setpoints: ``$ curl http://127.0.0.1/advance/<testid> -d '{"oveTSetRooHea_u":293.15,"oveTSetRooHea_activate":1, "oveTSetRooCoo_activate":1,"oveTSetRooCoo_u":298.15}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"``.  Leave an empty json to advance the simulation using the setpoints embedded in the model.
- End the test: ``$ curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1/stop/<testid>``

## Development

This repository uses pre-commit to ensure that the files meet standard formatting conventions (such as line spacing, layout, etc).
Presently only a handful of checks are enabled and will expanded in the near future. To run pre-commit first install
pre-commit into your Python version using pip `pip install pre-commit`. Pre-commit can either be manually by calling
`pre-commit run --all-files` from within the BOPTEST checkout directory, or you can install pre-commit to be run automatically
as a hook on all commits by calling `pre-commit install` in the root directory of the BOPTEST GitHub checkout.
